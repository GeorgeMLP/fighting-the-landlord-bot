# Fighting the Landlord Bot
A bot for the game FightTheLandlord2 on Botzone ([Botzone](https://www.botzone.org.cn/)) with detailed annotations, using the MCTS (Monte-Carlo Tree Search) method. I also uploaded ```Game Platform.cpp```, which can be used to play games between bots locally. Its method of usage is described in ```How to use Game Platform.pdf```.
